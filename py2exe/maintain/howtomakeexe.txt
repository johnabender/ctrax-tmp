1) Install dependencies in unzipped, non-egg form:
$ easy_install.exe --always-unzip Ctrax
[http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/ExeWithEggs]
Remove installed Ctrax (C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\Ctrax...) to avoid confusion (nec?)
***This didn't work when I tried it with Python27 8/12/11 JAB.

1.1) Make sure that Python27 has a copy of MSVCP90.dll in c:\python27\dlls.

1.2) If the motmot packages were built from source (which is currently the only way to install them for Python 2.7), they will install only .egg files in the site-packages directory. In that case, copy_files_here.py will look in py2exe/maintain/py-sources for the needed source files. These are distributed with the Ctrax source tree, but should be replaced with the ones built on the compiling PC.

The files imops.pyd, ufmf.py, wxvalidatedtext.py, and wxvideo.py can be found in the build/ directories of their respective source trees after being compiled. Copy them into the py2exe/maintain/py-sources directory.

1.3) Carefully replace _gdi.py in the wx installation directory (c:\python27\lib\site-packages\wx-2.8-msw-unicode\wx) with the version in the py2exe/maintain/wx-mod directory. The only differences should be a try/except block inserted around line 911 in BitmapFromBufferRGBA(). This edit is to fix an error that seems to have no effect other than printing to the console during analysis-plot viewing, so this step can be skipped if necessary.

2) [steps 2,3,4,5 are now combined in the script 'maintain/prepare_build.sh']

Copy Ctrax and motmot stuff here

***
python copy_files_here.py
***

3) Remove pkg_resources from motmot. Currently, pkg_resources is not used by any of the required files (removed from currently installed motmot/simple_overlay). 

***
python removepkgresources.py
***

4) Replace import statements for motmot libraries

***
python replacemotmotimports.py
***

5) Set Ctrax version number correctly in EXE compilation script

***
python update_version_number.py
***

6) Compare the Ctrax/setup.py and py2exe/setup_py2exe.py scripts -- see if there are any changes to setup.py that need to manually be added to the old setup_py2exe.py script.

7) Only needs to be done if scipy has been reinstalled; a couple of import hacks:

In C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\scipy\ndimage\__init__.py
change:
from io import *
to
from scipy.io import *

8) [steps 8,9,10,11 are now combined in the script 'maintain/do_build.sh']

Try to build

***
cd ..
python setup_py2exe.py build -c mingw32
***

9) Try to make py2exe

***
python setup_py2exe.py build -c mingw32 py2exe
***

10) Copy dlls that are not automatically copied:

***
cp maintain/dlls/* dist/.
cp build/lib.win32-2.5/*pyd dist/.
***

These dlls are:
   _cobyla.pyd - /c/Python25/lib/site-packages/scipy/optimize/_cobyla.pyd
   MSVCP71.dll - /c/Python25/lib/site-packages/wx-2.8-msw-unicode/wx/MSVCP71.dll
   gdiplus.dll - /c/Python25/lib/site-packages/wx-2.8-msw-unicode/wx/gdiplus.dll
   specfun.pyd - /c/Python25/lib/site-packages/scipy/special/specfun.pyd
   OpenCV DLLs - C:\Users\benderj\Downloads\opencv-2.4.13\build\x86\vc12\bin

11) Copy XML resources and icons (not automatically copied):

***
cp -R xrc dist/
cp -R icons dist/
cp -R mpl-data dist/
***

12) Try it out:
$ cd dist
$ ./Ctrax.exe

13) Make the Windows installer using NSIS:
Compile the script setup.nsi in the py2exe directory. (Start > NSIS, Compile NSI Scripts, File > Load > setup.nsi)

14) This makes a file Ctrax-(ver).exe in the current directory that can be distributed. Try it out by double-clicking and installing.
