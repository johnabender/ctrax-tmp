Matlab, particularly v. 2009a, has trouble saving and loading function 
handles correctly. the "f2i" field of the "trx" variable is a function 
that inputs the frame number and returns the index into the trx fields 
corresponding to that frame. In the past, it had been saved and loaded, 
but now save_tracks removes it and load_tracks restores it.

Fixed bug in make_ctrax_result_movie. If the movie was an AVI, then fid was being set to -1, and make_ctrax_result_movie was interpreting this as the movie being unreadable. Also, it tried to close the fid at the end of the function.
