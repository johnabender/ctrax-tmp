Steps to test Ctrax GUI
=======================
= Unopened movies =
-Try changing all available options in all menus.
-Try play button, stop button, speed-up/slow-down buttons.
-Try changing text in frame number box, etc.
-Check "Ask for annotation file names" in the Settings menu.

= Opening movies =
-Open "open movie" dialog and cancel.
-Choose an FMF movie.
-Cancel the selection of the annotation filename. Ctrax should exit.
-Open an FMF movie. Choose the default annotation filename (should be the movie's name + '.ann').
-Open "open movie" dialog and cancel.
-Scroll backward and forward in time through the movie, ending in the middle somewhere.
-Open "open movie" dialog and cancel.
-Open each different movie type (SBFMF, FMF, UFMF, AVI) in different directories and scroll backward and forward in each movie type. Verify that default directory is always the directory of the last-opened movie, that the default file type is the last file type opened, and that the annotation filename is the movie's name + '.ann'.
-In Windows, open each movie type (not AVI) by double-clicking on the movie file in Explorer. Verify annotation filenames, frame scrolling, and directory memory.
-In Windows and Mac, open movies by dropping them on top of the Ctrax window. Drop non-movie files on top of the Ctrax window.
-Uncheck "Ask for annotation file names" in the Settings menu.
